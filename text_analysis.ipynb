      "  Sure, so on GrowthChannel we are a software technology company based in Austin. We have been around for about a year from now since we launched publicly. We automated marketing planning. We work with startups, SMBs, agencies and enterprise marketing teams. So usually marketers would use our solution to automate market research, identify their ideal customer profiles and help their customer decision journey. Our tool is also AI based, which we use ourselves, of course. We also use a few other tools ourselves, which are also AI based.   We help you save time and also identify growth opportunities for your startups, SMB, or enterprise marketing team. Agencies also use our solution to help them scale faster. So let us say right now they considering the current resources, they might be doing one marketing plan with their resources and our tool can multiply it by 20.   I am the founder.   That was a lot of things.   Yeah. All right, so we do small promotion and customer feedback about one of the feature updates within our platform. We published and shared information about one of the startup interviews we have done prior in Clubhouse. Checked social schedule, checked the analytics. We do weekly analytics. Checked with the team. Made plan for the week. Talked to customers. Made a few demos. Checked about upcoming event preparation. So that is kind of a few things. Let me see what else. Yeah, I think those are the main things.   Yeah. So once a month we co-host a startup interview. So its usually a startup story with early stage startup, like an Indie Hacker or a Maker, a small team or an early stage, but they are not funded, but have growth and traction. So we talk about how they grow their startup bootstrapping from nothing to something, and well talk about their background, what channels they use, what their product is about, what problem they solve, who their product is for, what their next step is in their startup journey, are they planning to raise capital or not and why, and so on. So we have done, I think, three or four of them already. So its been going for some small period of time. We are doing it with this Sloop AI, so another startup, which is doing very different thing than what we do. they are a video and audio interactive sharing platform. We are part of the same startup accelerator program, so we decided to do that to basically just have a chat live with people to connect with other startups, but also share cool stories that are related. But also for marketing purposes. So many different reasons why you do it, but its also fun. So after the Clubhouse event is over, we record those and we publish recap posts on our Medium channel, which we also submit to The Startup publication on Medium. We also do a post on Indie Hackers, which is a Maker for which is pretty big one.   Yeah, so on top of our own solution, we use AI in different ways. So first we use it for analytics, so we use predictive analytics module to help us predict when we can hit our target KPIs and how far off we are. And then we set a roadmap to try to accelerate that analytics. So that is one. The second one, we use AI to help us generate content. So we produce lots of content everything from social, to emails, to blogs, to other content that is going all around. But, yeah, basically, whenever we are overwhelmed, or out of ideas, or need a little bit of inspiration, we would just turn to the AI to meet some of those workflows as well. So our marketing associates would also use content writing AI systems to defer that to. So that is another one. Let me think. What else are we using?   Yeah, sure. there is actually one blog post that we co-published with our AI tool, so let me... I can even link you to that. So we are trying to keep a goal of publishing at least one blog post every two weeks. Recently we were doing at least one, but the goal is minimum one in two weeks for our blog to be fresh for Google search results. There was this one week when we were like, \"Okay, we really need to publish something, but do not have time to write it,\" so we just went back to our AI to help us write it. So Ill drop a link in chat if you want some background information. So we were just like, \"Hey, here is a topic,\" what were doing to give to our AI a little bit more background information to spit it out a few paragraphs of text, which was very relevant, so were like, \"Okay, I can use that.\" So, just put it in a blog post.   Yeah, for this specific case it mainly worked. So it work in terms of, \"Hey, we could, in a very fast manner, generate the blog post.\" So it was fresh for our website updates. In what ways it did not work is that this specific tool we use, is not considering the SEO elements. So some of the texts that was produced was not exactly SEO-friendly, so those are some of the things that had to be polished on top of it. But the time it took to prepare the whole thing, editing it does not take as much. So its a small thing that needs to happen on top of it. But there are also a few other AI tools that, basically, take the next step and make sure that the content that is generated is specifically for SEO. When I tried testing some of those, I think I have found limitations when it comes to does it sound humanly, or does not sound like its reading for Google. So I think that is the limitation that I saw with some of those other tools. But I would I guess prefer to make it a bit more natural and then just edit the keywords myself than the other way around.   Yeah, so we also use predictive analytics to help us identify... let us say, we set a goal for a specific KPI. Our tool will tell us when are we set to approximately reach that goal.   Well, let us say we want to go to, I do not know, 1,000 visits a day on our website, or let us say we want to decrease bounce rate. Our bounce rate is actually pretty low, so I do not think we are looking at that goal, but let us say average session duration we want to go from two minutes to four minutes, just to give an example. And then well consider the past improvements over the history of I think one year or so, and then estimate when we can basically reached the new goal based on the past performance. So in our team then they were like, \"Hey, this is a while. We need to scale up. let us do some activities to make the time shorter, to improve our projections, to improve our performance.\" So this is also how it would work within using our own analytics and make sure that we can plan our marketing to improve it even better. And other ways we are using AI is also to help us recommend ideal customer profiles, usually on LinkedIn because were a B2B company. So in that case, we submit the demographic profile of who were looking to reach, a little bit about our product, our objective in terms of lead generation, for example, and our AI will tell us, \"Hey, these are audiences that match your profile, this is what they are looking to achieve, this is are their challenges is, these are their interests, and so on.   Yeah, so, there are the three aims. So I would say that for KPIs, its just we would need to calculate if we are ever going to reach our objective and when it could be, so it will just take longer I guess to calculate versus automatically. For personas, the same thing, you would need to go manually look on LinkedIn and figure out, \"Hey, let us find some profiles and see if they match.\" So that might take some time as well. And then try to figure out what are they looking to achieve and what other platforms are they active on and what content... doing it all one by one looking at each profile manually will just take forever. So if you can use automation to bring the most relevant information to you, that is way better. And then for the content, content usually is very creative part, so I guess this is where the AI is a little maybe a question mark,. But at the same time it also takes so much time, for brainstorming to figure out some relevant content that you can mention, or even just to get started. To get started is usually one of those things that you need to break through. So if you can automate those parts that just saves saves someone so much time.   Yeah, so my background is in marketing myself. So in my past roles I would do everything manually. And I think it was just also about three or four years ago when technology was picking up that I was like, \"Okay, there might be a way to maybe automate it. let us figure it out.\" But, yeah, we also use some external tools so, which are AI based. We do not just use our own tools, so we also use other tools which are AI driven and we just like it because we can automate more.   Yeah, so we actually are using a few tools. So for example, we use Seamless AI, which is really nice for sales prospecting, which we also use for like B2B LinkedIn prospecting.   Yeah, so it helps us find the profiles, information that is most relevance, and also keep us updated about main changes within the company, main changes within the person, within just the Seamless approach. So kind of goes in hand with our own vision for what the personas stand for. Its just an extra level of helping you to actually execute on your campaigns on top of our tool, when it just tells you hey this is your targeting audience and there are samples, and this is how big it is. The Seamless AI basically helps you go to the next level, like this is the audience, this is what they are doing, this are updates about their company. These are the messages that you can use for this specific person to reach out to them, which are already personalized to this people and so on.   Yeah. Well, there are so many others similar tools to Seamless AI, first of all. And secondly, we really focus on planning, at least right now. So planning we also started with optimization, a little bit, but its really a lot about planning and helping you plan your activities, and that is because we feel in the market right now, this specific area there is a big gap, because nobody offers a similar tool or solution. And when it comes to B2B sales prospecting, or activating marketing campaigns, there are actually a whole bunch of tools. There are most probably hundreds of them, or if not thousand of them. So its a very crowded market and there are already lots of solutions out there that can help you figure out how you can solve your problem.   Yeah. So I would say Seamless AI would say that it helps you to actually execute on your marketing plan. So its kind of the step that you would do after you have figured out who you are targeting and what is your marketing strategy like.   Yeah, so we have people who have backgrounds in data analytics, AI and backend engineering, so that is one of the founding members. we have got people who have backgrounds in UX design. So another founding member. And then we have more other people who came in later during the project, so people who are dealing with front end development, full stack, separate backend engineering. And then we have got also marketing associates and sales people.   As well as advisors, of course. Advisors are very important too.   Sure. So we have right now two advisors. So we have got advisor on a strategic level for helping us with, let us say, business modeling, financial strategy, product strategy, or other strategy-related questions. So that is Yagub Rahimov. His background and experience is mainly within actually strategy, business development, management. Then we have got commercial advisor for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Philipp Feldvoss. So his background is also a lot in business development, sales, partnerships. So hes really helping us develop channels within the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region.   Sure. So for example, we keep on testing our pricing. I think that is one thing that we have not cracked yet fully. So we actually updated our pricing, I think like four times or so in the last year. And so our advisor is actually kind of my initial, at least, go-to for when I am thinking like, \"Hey, we have got this batch of feedback from our users regarding our pricing and plans. let us brainstorm on what would be the better alternative pricing structure.\" So we would usually hop on a call. We are remote teams, so we always have calls. So hop a call to discuss user feedback, to brainstorm a few ideas about new potential structure, then I would usually like put together a new format, turn it around, get feedback, maybe do a few more iterations. And then, basically, its a lot about getting great feedback from them. And I think like that is one of the ways that we work together. Other way we work together is like, \" Hey,\" let us say, \"there is a great potential partner. let us discuss how we can work together,\" and then they would try to help us manage those relationships as well. Or at least do an introduction, at the minimum.   Sure. So I think one of the kind of relatively new partnership from our European advisor is with SafetyWing. SafetyWing is an insurance for remote teams. they are one of the Y Combinator companies. they have been around I think for, I do not know, four years or something like this. Anyway, its a pretty big company right now. They have many different divisions and a pretty big team. So that is actually a great partnership that were pretty proud of. So what Philip did he... I do not know how he connected with them but anyway at some point in time, I got connected with them via introduction to Philip, and they were like, \"Okay, what do you think about this partnership structure?\" So that is the first time I heard about this, and so they had the whole initial conversation before. And it was like, \"Yeah, that sounds great,\" or, \"Hey, these are a few maybe iteration we had,\" maybe minor things. But overall it was \"Yes, let us do it.\" And then again he would manage the whole setting up the actual partnership, so then I would just get an email, \"Hey, this is our tracking link. This is where we are featured. Can you make sure you include us on your website. When is the next newsletter scheduled announcing the partnership? When other social posts scheduled.\" And then we also I think got a contribution article from their team to post on our blog, which also went out I think a few weeks ago or something. So I think he was doing majority of introduction and then making sure the deal is closed. And then whenever there was a decision making point, I was involved. But overall great help on that front. I think that was one of the very good examples. Yeah.   Yeah, I think there were a few questions to come from around commission, referrals, tracking links, what we will do and what they will do from their side of the partnerships, so those kind of terms, more, I would say, very specific terms rather than general.   Yeah, so I do not remember all the details and most probably I would not want to share all the specific details, but in general, so we did the announcement of the partnership on our site, did a small promotion via a newsletter, social media channels and included it also in a blog post that they contributed. And, of course, we included them on our website as a partner with the logo under partnerships. And then on their side they included us in their partnerships list, and included, I think, our offer as a part of their kind of marketplace offers from partners. Listen page, and also helped us share it on social and their email channels. And then there are a few referal opportunities that are also shared between each other.\"   Yeah, the goal of the partnership is so they focus on startups and we focused on startups as a part of our business. So we are basically partnering up to help each other reach more startups. So its really more of let us call it a co-marketing partnership. So they help share about information about GrowthChannel and we help share information about SafetyWing. they are also a lot about helping remote teams, so remote startups. So we specifically focus on remote startups, and then we would refer back to SafetyWing.   Yes.   Yeah. So, we have raised a family and friends round, as well as the pre-seed round last year. And since then we have been operating for about a year.   Yeah. So, in our case, we raised pre-seed. So not to yet the seed. I think that is still something were working on. So for the pre-seed, we applied for an accelerator program. We actually applied for a few. And then luckily we had a choice at the end, so that was great. But yeah, we basically just applied for a few accelerator programs, because we felt like we wanted to go through a program to get mentors on top of just the funding for the early stage, and this is what they did. that is kind of was our focus. And then for the family and friends round, that was more about talking to friends and family members about the startup, a lot, sharing information and then preparing like pitch deck, other projections, financial projections, a few other materials to share with them to get them interested to join the project.   Yeah, so I was actually very happy with our specific accelerator program. When I speak to startups, almost every day, I hear lots of different stories, so I am really happy about my experience. So during our program, we had a 12-week program which the first two months were focused on really kind of learning about different elements of running a startup, everything from legal, to HR, to marketing, sales, customer feedback, market research. I do not remember what other elements, but basically all of the different chapters. Every week is a different focus area. And during that week we would have one session which was, I think, two hours long, to actually discuss theory, we would have to do lots of reading and then we would have to discuss about what we have read and what do we think about this whole thing, and what is our plan in terms of next step to actually implement that as a part in our startup. During the week we would have mentors talk about that topic, who would be the expert in that area to share their experience, advice and you could ask questions. And then another session would be you would have some kind of homework to do on that specific topic to implement that specific topic as a part of our startup. For example, during HR week, we had to write a job description as a part of homework, actually post it live and get some people to interview. So we had to have everything structured during that one week. So, yeah, that is kind of how it ran and during each week we could also speak to our investors, like extra hours of mentorship, ask questions, get feedback, get direction and all that. So lots of stuff that was a really crazy 12 weeks. But it was a great experience. The last months main focus was on a demo day. So for the demo day we also had 70-something investors who came in to listen to our pitches, and that went very well as well. Lots of great introductions. So along the way, investors would also do introductions to potential partners, customers, other investors who could join in the next round of fundraising. And they are still doing that by the way. So one of the great parts I guess about our program, accelerator, and investors is that its not just about the program only. Its also kind of this ongoing support and mentorship and introductions. So that is great.   Yeah, so during the demo day we had... how many were we? Like six companies or seven companies in a cohort. So we would all do our pitch and share our sides to the pitch. It was virtual because of the COVID. And then the investors could ask questions. I think it was about... how many was it? Like three to five minutes for a pitch, plus another five minutes I think for Q&A. So it was about 10 minutes per startup. It was about a one-hour long event, so, yeah, so it just goes first startup, next startup and so on. And then investors sent out our information, like one-pager text to investors who have attended and registered and our contact information so that they could get back in touch with us if they wanted to ask any other questions or were interested to continue the conversation. So that is kind of how it-   Yeah, we had lots of follow ups. We had lots of great conversations.   Yeah so, with a lot of most of them it was actually showing a live demonstration of the platform, or talking a little bit more about or financials or the team, or kind of going deeper into specific customer segment that we have, or talk about our \"Go-to-market strategy,\" Everyone focuses on kind of very different areas so its hard to say. For one I had one follow up which was they were specifically interested about us helping enterprise marketing teams, and I think we were too early for that. So it was a great conversation we were too early for them. Or we had a few great introductions for Series A and Series B onwards, investors. Great conversations, but, again, a little bit too early for that but they already want to make those connections and they keep on showing interest. I think, a few of them even reached out second time saying, \"Hey, its been a while since we talked. let us catch up and see how you guys are doing, just to touch base,\" type of thing. So we had some great conversations; a few investors who actually were interested in joining, but I did not feel like they were in line with our own vision, so we did not agree to proceed there and then-   Yeah, so like one of the very prominent examples is that a VCs focus specifically to just do the seed round and then make sure that the startup does not get additional investment and just exits, so basically sells the company right after, which is not what we want to do.   I want to develop our technology to have a full marketing management system for everyone, and then go for an IPO.   Yeah. So they were pretty straightforward. They said, \"Hey, how you do it? We think you have an interesting product. We would love to continue by we would want you to work on your exits and we like to be the last money in for the startup.\" So for us its more like our goal right now is to make sure we get the seed, so then we can get to the next level and bring up a little bit more of a optimization module in our platform, to help you optimize your current marketing campaigns and then also maybe launch more of your marketing campaigns through our dashboard to connect with our tools you use. So make it more of a comprehensive marketing management solution rather than just planning. So to connect with those like Seamless AI in a more seamless way, call it. And make sure that we have, I do not know, millions of marketers use it every day. So that would be kind of the goal, rather than we just sold the project to someone.   Yeah, they were great.   Yeah, so I think every piece of advice was very useful. They actually started giving us feedback even before we started the accelerator program. So even during the interview process that we. They had spent quite significant time just giving us feedback during the interviews, which was great.   Yeah, so they made sure that they test our product before accepting us into their program. So they gave introduction to three of their companies in their portfolio and then they sat in their screen sharing for them actually experience the product live. And then they would to tell us, \"Hey, you should do maybe this part this way.\" Or they would actually share the feedback during the live screen sharing, product using session. So, for example, when we launched our MVP last year in July, which they were testing, we had a Typeform integration instead of our own custom dashboard intake form, and there were lots of limitations with Typeform. For example, it was very hard to go back to the previous question, or the multiple choice was not all that straightforward. Those are some of the simple things that I remember they already pointed out. Another thing was we started with just one-off marketing plans instead of making these kind of recurring membership or subscription model. So lots of feedback on the pricing. Then great feedback in terms of they were actually the ones telling me I have to hire a sales team, which I was not sure about. But, yeah, my background is in marketing, and I think I do it really well, but also I am thinking a lot about product. And at a startup you always have to push for sales, at least as much as product, if not more. And I think this is the part its kind of hard to break in sometimes, although I try to make sure my calendar is kind of half and half. But as a founder, you cannot do a hundred things a day. So I actually went ahead and hired a sales team. And then they also advised me on a structure for the sales team, which was great in terms of commission sizing and all that. So they also helped us set those terms up.   Well, for sales, for marketing for my gain, so there are actually lots of great mentors for specific areas, just like I mentioned. We would have a VIP mentor come in every week, based on the topic focus of that specific week, but then also the partner investors from the accelerator program, they had a very diverse experience also within like SaaS platform, sales, marketing, and other areas, so they were lots of times open from their own experience as well.   Maybe like at different times. But, yeah, I do not recall anything specific at the moment. But I am sure we disagree the different times, of course, but I think it was not anything too major, because I cannot really recall specific instance.   You mean like our product or our use of external platforms?   Yeah, because they are all interested in our product and how it works.   Yeah, there oftentimes questions as we get its just like, \"Okay, how does your AI work?\" So then we have to describe the backend processes. We have questions about where does the data come from? So that is an often question. Or, yeah, I think those are the two most common questions.   Well, I think they want to make sure that they invest in the proprietary technology first, because there are lots of already set up AI frameworks that you can just connect to and apply to your own products and then you have an AI product. Or other cases that I see personally most often testing different tools as a marketer is that lots of tools are automating something, and then they say, \"Oh, I have an AI.\" So that is also I guess part of this conversation. And then the data sources is just interesting as well. Like, okay, making sure that you have data that, okay, the data is valid, that its reliable, how much data do you have, and so on.   Yeah, so we actually have a white paper about it, as well, about the AI and predicting overall experience, and making sure that you can actually not just automate, but also estimate the performance. So the way we use AI is mainly for the second part of the marketing plan generation. The first part of the marketing plan is actually just automation. So within our tool, we kind of split into three parts. The first part is the market analysis, where you basically get information about, \"Okay, how are you doing it compared to your competition in terms of the website performance, advertising, what the top trends within the industry, what should be the focus keywords and all that?\" So that is the part when we collect lots of data from external sources via API or scrapers and then we basically put it together faster. So that is automation. But then the second part of the report, which is persona identification and customer journey mapping, is where we use our proprietary technology to help you actually identify who your target audience should be and what exactly is their decision journey like. So we also do predictive analytics there to identify, \"Okay, what are the channels which are most likely to show better results? What are the content opportunities there? What are the content that people interacted with in the past, that they are likely to interact with in the future, considering your own product or service that you are trying to promote?\" And so on. So that is basically what our tool does in this matter.   Yeah, so the first part, the market research, its simple automation. You get information from other sources, you filter it, you organize it in a better way, which most probably will save you like a day or so. So that is kind of just simple automation, but you can save a whole day. And the second part is this simulation, making sure that we help you identify your ideal customer profiles and we have their customer decision journey, so identify the channels, the content opportunities, KPI, budgeting for your campaign.   Yeah. So the difference is automation versus predictive analytics that you have there and also identifying... well automation plus predictive analytics to help you identify all that information.   I would not know.   Yeah, this is a great question. I actually have six core values. I do not think I remember all of them by heart, I might want to look at my notes, but one of them is Formula One. So we want to make sure that they do everything fast and not just like production-wise and development, but also making sure that the iterate fast and put customers feedback into action fast, too. So we have in our Slack our QA channel and everyone who is communicating with customers will always contribute something there on almost daily basis, something that we hear basically from our customers what they say about the tool or issues they experience, or just questions they ask if we need to add to our knowledge base, basically. So that is kind of one. The second one is flexibility. So we tried to definitely be open, flexible, and transparent within the team. We actually have five different countries within our team. So we have got people from you.S., from Nigeria. we have got people in Ukraine, Germany, Serbia. I think I missed something. But, yeah, basically that is kind of the scope. So we definitely want to make sure that we welcome each other. Then we have got focus on the user, which I kind of touched base a little bit. Innovation is definitely something that we focus on a lot, so we do not want to be following all the time. The solutions already in the market, so we always try to innovate and bring something new to the space. New or very much better in the space, so that we can add value. Working as a team is really important. So were a remote team, so sometimes it can be a little bit hard. We try not to work in silos, so definitely like, have a chat together on Slack, jump on that Zoom call together and to discuss different topics. We also do virtual parties once a month to just connect informally. So the last one was actually just this Saturday. We had virtual lunch, a lunch slash dinner, lunch for us and dinner for people in the other timezone. So that was cool too. Then we have be transparent and take responsibility. So those are some of the other things.   Actually have [crosstalk 00:47:33].   Yeah, so the six things are focus on the user, innovate, work as a team, be transparent, take responsibility, and go Formula One.   Yeah, so take responsibility means that we always seek to find a solution, we are accountable for our actions, when we encounter mistakes we fix them, and our platform is the result of everyone is effort and hard work, every team member has the answer or has the power to make our ecosystem better. And yes I read it from my designs that I put together for the team.   Yeah, definitely. So, for example, in regards, I do not know, one of the bugs, let us say in the in the platform. And then someone would put it on our Q&A channel on our Slack. So a person would put it like, \"Has no clue who to tag,\" because they are like, \"This is the issue on the platform.\" And then people would jumping from development. So we have four developers on the team. they are just like ask questions, try to figure out, \"Hey, was I the one you know who needs to fix it, who has the power to do that?\" Or another person will like, \"Hey, I think this could be the issue.\" Everyone is trying to collaborate, trying to fix the problem, trying to see if they could be contributing or if its their issue, even their code that they have written and stuff like this. So, yeah, that happens everyday.   Yeah, there are lots of great startups that I definitely follow and seek to be kind of in a similar shoes. In terms of, I think, different areas of business most probably very different startups would go, because my background is in marketing and kind of can relate better to most probably the marketing areas specifically. So for marketing, I really like what HubSpot has done that their partnership program, with the events they do, with their content marketing hub. So all of that, were definitely trying to do our best to make sure we go to, I do not know, 1% of what they are doing with our resources. But, yeah, definitely. they are great at making sure their content is there and they bring that to their followers and customers. They have great partner program and they are always trying to bring you educational resources and also connection points via events, webinars and so on for their customers and prospects. So definitely something that is a great example of that specific space.   Yeah, like there is four things that I could just mention. So first like their blog with all the content that they are generating. And they also have lots of information under lead magnets. Lead magnets are downloadable resources where you fill in a form and then you download only after you provide certain information. So this is something were trying to do. Not at their scale, of course, but as much as we can. The second one I would say from their side is their pregnant program for agencies is amazing. The way they turn agencies into customers and the way they partner with them. They offer different tiers and kind of different resources to help agencies promote HubSpot and make sure that they display their HubSpot certified and their HubSpot partner everywhere they go to basically promote HubSpot. So that is really cool. And then we are trying to do something similar, but again we are so small, and the way we do it is most probably, maybe just 1%. And then another one is just their webinars and different events that they offer to their community, which is also really cool and something that they are planning for after we close our next round.   Yes. And, but not in a very big spectrum. So we have discussed how we can offer our platform to nonprofit organizations. And then maybe startups who do not have the funds yet, but definitely need our solution. So we actually plan to offer that via accelerator programs. So for smaller cohorts, startups could apply and get our solution for free to use if they are approved.   We are planning, so that is what comes through accelerator partnerships. So our own accelerator is Optenni for that. And then were also making a partnership with another accelerator in Kansas and another one in Netherlands. So were in discussions with those two to close it and then we can have three accelerators, so at least we have a drop down, select an accelerator program that you are a part of, and then you would need to submit a short form for us to review your application before we accept you into the free... you will get basically a full access without paying anything.   I am female.   I am white.   I have got Bachelor of Science.   Yes.   What do you mean by business identity? How you would categorize? We have about 10 people on the team, so I do not know of that is important.   Yeah, there is not really something very specific. We definitely are standing for automating, marketing, planning and making sure you bring marketing intelligence to you in an automated manner. So that if you do not have the data right now for your marketing, you can actually get it with GrowthChannel, because we mostly rely on secondary data sources. So let us say if you are a startup, or if you are just launching something new and you have no clue what to do because there is not anything like this yet in the market, then basically that is oftentimes what is the use case for GrowthChannel is if you basically do not have access to the data or lack of data of your own primary data in this case, so then our tool connects to secondary data sources mainly, although we can also connect to primary if you have the data. And then make sure that you have a data, data-driven marketing plan based on that. \n"
